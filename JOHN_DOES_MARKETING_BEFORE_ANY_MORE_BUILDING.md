# STOP BUILDING. START MARKETING.

> "Features don't matter without users to use them."

You have a working product. Rest timer? Done. Backdate workouts? Done. SEO metadata? Done. Coach features? Done.

**What you don't have: users.**

No more features until this plan is complete. Every time you think "wouldn't it be cool if..." - come back here and do marketing work instead.

## Phase 3: Product Hunt / Indie Hackers Launch

### Pre-Launch Prep

- [ ] **Create Product Hunt account** (if not exists)
  - Build up some activity first (upvote things, comment)
  - Need ~1 week of activity before posting

- [ ] **Prep PH assets**
  - Tagline: "AI workout programs for people who hate complicated fitness apps"
  - Description: Focus on simplicity, beginners, free tier
  - Screenshots: Dashboard, program generation, workout logging
  - Maker comment ready

- [ ] **Create Indie Hackers post**
  - "I built a fitness app and can't get users - here's what I'm trying"
  - Vulnerability + asking for feedback = engagement
  - Link to product naturally

- [ ] **Pick launch day**
  - Tuesday-Thursday typically best for PH
  - Avoid holidays, major tech news days

### Launch Day

- [ ] Post to PH at 12:01am PT (when new day starts)
- [ ] Share on Twitter/X
- [ ] Post to relevant subreddits (see Phase 4)
- [ ] Email anyone you know who might upvote

---

## Phase 4: Reddit Strategy

**The Rules:**
1. Never post "check out my app" - you'll get banned
2. Be genuinely helpful first
3. Your profile link does the selling
4. 10 helpful comments for every 1 subtle mention

### Target Subreddits

**High Value (active, beginner-friendly):**
- r/fitness (3M+ members) - Daily Simple Questions thread
- r/loseit (3M+ members) - Weight loss focused
- r/gainit (500k) - Skinny guys wanting to bulk
- r/xxfitness (800k) - Women's fitness
- r/bodyweightfitness (2M) - No-equipment crowd

**Medium Value:**
- r/homegym - Equipment discussions
- r/StartingStrength - Beginner lifting
- r/Stronglifts5x5 - Program-specific

**Coach Acquisition (find coaches, not clients):**
- r/personaltraining (30k) - Active trainers discussing biz
- r/fitnessindustry (5k) - Industry talk, small but engaged
- r/personaltrainers (10k) - Similar to above
- r/OnlinePersonalTrainer (3k) - Your exact target market

**Coach Reddit Tactics:**
- Answer "what software do you use" questions
- Chime in on client management frustrations
- Don't pitch—ask what they wish existed
- Profile link + "building something for this" in bio

### Reddit Tactics

- [ ] **Update Reddit profile**
  - Bio: "Building baisics.co - simple workout tracking"
  - Pinned post or profile link visible

- [ ] **Daily routine: 15-30 mins**
  - Sort by New in target subs
  - Answer 3-5 beginner questions helpfully
  - Never mention your app unless directly relevant
  - Let profile link do the work

- [ ] **Content that works:**
  - Form check feedback
  - Program recommendations
  - "Here's what worked for me" stories
  - Calling out fitness BS

---

## Phase 5: Coach Outreach

### Finding Coaches

**Where to look:**
- Instagram: search "online fitness coach", "online personal trainer"
- Hashtags: #onlinecoach #fitnesspro #personaltrainer
- Look for: 1k-30k followers, posts client transformations, "DM for coaching" in bio

**Red flags to avoid:**
- Massive accounts (won't respond)
- Pure supplement/product shills
- No evidence of actual clients
- MLM vibes

### Qualification Checklist

Before DMing, verify:
- [ ] They actually have clients (client wins posted)
- [ ] They respond to comments (engaged)
- [ ] Roster looks small (5-20 clients ideal)
- [ ] Not already using a platform prominently

### DM Scripts

**Initial Outreach (Cold):**
```
Hey [name] - saw your post about [specific client win you noticed]. Nice work getting [specific result].

Quick question: what do you use to program workouts for your clients? Spreadsheets? An app?

Building something specifically for coaches with small rosters and curious what sucks about current options.
```

**If They Respond Positively:**
```
Cool - yeah I built baisics.co specifically for this.

Would you be down to try it with one client for free? Just want honest feedback on what works and what's broken.

No pitch, no catch - just trying to make it actually useful before charging anyone.
```

**If They're Already Using Something:**
```
Got it - what do you like/hate about [their tool]?

Building something focused specifically on [their pain point if mentioned]. Would love to show you when it's ready if you're open to it.
```

### Outreach Tracking

| Coach | Platform | Followers | DM Sent | Response | Status |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|----------|--------|
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |

**Target: 20 DMs/week, expect 2-3 responses, 1 trial user**

---

## Phase 6: Build in Public (Twitter/X)

### Account Setup

- [ ] **Bio that explains what you're building**
  - "Building @baisics_co - simple fitness tracking for normal people"
  - Link to site

- [ ] **Pinned tweet**
  - What you're building and why
  - Or a thread about the journey

### Content Types That Work

1. **Progress updates** - "Just shipped X feature"
2. **Metrics (even bad ones)** - "0 → 5 users this week"
3. **Learnings** - "Tried X, didn't work, here's why"
4. **Behind the scenes** - Screenshots of code, design iterations
5. **Asks** - "Building X - what would make you use it?"

### Daily Routine (15 mins)

- [ ] Post 1 thing (update, learning, question)
- [ ] Reply to 5-10 relevant tweets
- [ ] Engage with other builders

---

| Day | Activity | Time |
|-----|----------|------|
| Mon | De-slop 1 blog post | 1-2 hrs |

## The Uncomfortable Truth

This work is boring. It's not building cool features. It's:
- Rewriting blog posts
- Sending DMs that get ignored
- Commenting on Reddit for no immediate return
- Waiting weeks for SEO to kick in

But this is what actually gets users. The product is ready. The problem is distribution.

**Every hour spent building features for 0 users = wasted.**
**Every hour spent getting users for existing features = compounding.**

---

## When You're Tempted to Build

Ask yourself:
1. Do I have 100 users yet? → No → Do marketing
2. Are 10+ people asking for this feature? → No → Do marketing
3. Will this feature get me more users? → Probably not → Do marketing

The only acceptable building:
- Fixing bugs that block signups
- Removing friction from onboarding
- Things coaches specifically ask for during outreach

Everything else can wait.
