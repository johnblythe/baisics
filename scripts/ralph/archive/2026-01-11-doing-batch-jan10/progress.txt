## Codebase Patterns

### Template Pages SEO Pattern
- Template detail pages need server/client split for SEO metadata
- Server component exports `generateMetadata` and renders client component
- Client component handles all interactive state (useState, useRouter, etc.)
- Pattern: `page.tsx` (server) imports `*Client.tsx` (client)
- Next.js 15: params is now a Promise, use `const { slug } = await params`

---

## 2026-01-10 17:XX - US-001: Add generateMetadata to template detail page
- **What was implemented:**
  - Converted template detail page to server component pattern
  - Added generateMetadata with title format: `{Template Name} - Free Workout Program | baisics`
  - Used template.description for meta description
  - Added OpenGraph tags (title, description, type: 'article')
- **Files created/changed:**
  - Created: `src/app/templates/[slug]/TemplateDetailClient.tsx` (client component)
  - Modified: `src/app/templates/[slug]/page.tsx` (server component with generateMetadata)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Next.js 15 requires `params` to be awaited: `const { slug } = await params`
  - The `PageProps` interface should be: `{ params: Promise<{ slug: string }> }`
  - Server/client component split is required for `generateMetadata` with client interactivity
---

## 2026-01-10 17:XX - US-002: Add JSON-LD structured data to template pages
- **What was implemented:**
  - Added `generateJsonLd` function to create ExercisePlan schema.org structured data
  - JSON-LD includes: name, description, exerciseType, activityDuration (ISO 8601), activityFrequency
  - Added additional properties for difficulty and splitType
  - Rendered as script tag with type application/ld+json in page body
- **Files created/changed:**
  - Modified: `src/app/templates/[slug]/page.tsx` (added JSON-LD generation and rendering)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - JSON-LD for ExercisePlan uses ISO 8601 duration format: `P${weeks}W`
  - JSON.stringify of trusted server-side template data is safe for inline scripts
  - Schema.org additionalProperty can extend ExercisePlan with custom fields
---

## 2026-01-10 17:XX - US-003: Widen program generation page layout
- **What was implemented:**
  - Widened layout from max-w-3xl to max-w-5xl for more spacious feel
  - Updated padding to v2a pattern: px-6 py-10
  - Enlarged hero section with responsive text sizes (lg:text-5xl)
  - Added more breathing room to chat container (md:p-8)
  - Increased form spacing (mt-6, space-y-5)
  - Enlarged textarea (rows 4, p-5) and button text (text-lg)
  - Increased quick prompt button padding (px-5 py-4) and grid gaps (gap-3)
- **Files created/changed:**
  - Modified: `src/app/hi/components/ConversationalInterface.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The /hi page layout is in ConversationalInterface.tsx, not page.tsx
  - v2a design pattern uses max-w-5xl or max-w-6xl with px-6 padding
  - Responsive padding with md: breakpoints helps mobile experience
---

## 2026-01-10 17:XX - US-004: Add coral accents to template detail page
- **What was implemented:**
  - Stats numbers in header now use coral (#FF6B6B) color and larger size (text-4xl)
  - Added coral accent bars (w-1 h-6 rounded-full) next to all section headers
  - Goals section, Features section, Workout Preview, Equipment, and Structure all have coral dividers
  - Goals/features tags already had coral styling (coralLight bg, coralDark text)
- **Files created/changed:**
  - Modified: `src/app/templates/[slug]/TemplateDetailClient.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Template detail already had v2a COLORS object defined at top of file
  - Coral accent pattern: small vertical bar (w-1 h-5/h-6) next to heading in flex container
  - Stats can stand out more with color + increased font size (text-3xl → text-4xl)
---

## 2026-01-10 17:XX - US-005: Make template detail CTA more prominent
- **What was implemented:**
  - Added coral gradient background to CTA section (`backgroundColor: COLORS.coralLight`)
  - Updated CTA button with gradient: `linear-gradient(to right, #FF6B6B, #FF8E8E)`
  - Added coral shadow: `boxShadow: '0 10px 15px -3px rgba(255, 107, 107, 0.25)'`
  - Increased button padding (py-4) and rounded corners (rounded-xl)
  - Added hover effects: `hover:shadow-xl hover:scale-[1.02]`
  - Updated button text with arrow: `'Generate My Program →'`
  - Changed day picker unselected state to white bg (better contrast on coral section)
- **Files created/changed:**
  - Modified: `src/app/templates/[slug]/TemplateDetailClient.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Inline styles needed for custom gradients/shadows not in Tailwind defaults
  - Coral-tinted section backgrounds make CTAs pop more than white backgrounds
  - Hover scale effects (scale-[1.02]) add nice micro-interaction
---

## 2026-01-10 17:XX - US-006: Add date picker to workout page
- **What was implemented:**
  - Added `workoutDate` state initialized to today's date
  - Added date picker UI in progress header with Calendar icon from lucide-react
  - Date picker button changes styling (coral bg) when a non-today date is selected
  - Shows "Logging for [date]" indicator when backdating
  - Uses native HTML date input with `max` attribute to prevent future dates
  - v2a styling: coral accents (#FF6B6B, #FFE5E5), rounded corners, shadows
- **Files created/changed:**
  - Modified: `src/app/workout/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Added helper functions: `formatDateForDisplay`, `formatDateForInput`, `isSameDay`
  - Native HTML date input with `max` attribute enforces date constraints
  - Adding 'T12:00:00' when parsing date string avoids timezone edge cases
  - Date picker state and UI separate from actual API calls (US-007 will wire it up)
---

## 2026-01-10 17:XX - US-007: Pass selected date to workout completion API
- **What was implemented:**
  - Updated POST /api/workout-logs to accept optional `date` param for backdating startedAt
  - Updated POST /api/workout-logs/[id]/complete to accept optional `completedAt` param
  - Both endpoints validate date is not in future (uses end of today for leniency)
  - Exercise logs also use the custom completedAt time when completing workout
- **Files created/changed:**
  - Modified: `src/app/api/workout-logs/route.ts`
  - Modified: `src/app/api/workout-logs/[id]/complete/route.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use try/catch when parsing optional JSON body (request.json() throws if no body)
  - Spread operator with conditional: `...(logDate && { startedAt: logDate })`
  - Date validation: compare against end of today (23:59:59.999) for better UX
---

## 2026-01-10 17:XX - US-008: Add audio alert to rest timer
- **What was implemented:**
  - Added `playAlertSound()` function using Web Audio API with dual oscillators
  - Sound is two short beeps (800Hz + 1000Hz) with gentle attack/decay envelope
  - Added `soundEnabled` state with localStorage persistence (`baisics_rest_timer_sound`)
  - Added sound toggle button with Volume2/VolumeX icons from lucide-react
  - Sound plays when timer reaches 0 (if enabled), uses `hasPlayedSound` ref to prevent duplicates
  - Toggle button uses coral styling when enabled, gray when disabled
- **Files created/changed:**
  - Modified: `src/app/components/RestPeriodIndicator.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Web Audio API: create AudioContext, oscillator, gainNode for sound generation
  - Safari fallback: `window.webkitAudioContext` for older Safari versions
  - Use empty catch block for graceful fallback when audio unavailable
  - useRef for preventing duplicate sound plays in setState callbacks
  - localStorage key pattern: `baisics_[feature]_[setting]`
---

## 2026-01-10 18:XX - US-009: Auto-start rest timer after set completion
- **What was implemented:**
  - Added `autoStart` prop to RestPeriodIndicator component
  - Added auto-start effect that starts timer immediately on mount when `autoStart={true}`
  - Added `showRestTimer` state and `restTimerKey` to workout page for timer visibility control
  - Added `triggerRestTimer()` callback that shows timer and increments key (forces fresh instance)
  - Wired up `onComplete` in BigSetInputCard to call `triggerRestTimer()` after marking set complete
  - Timer appears with fade-in animation after completing a set (if auto-start enabled)
  - Timer hides when navigating between exercises or when auto-start is toggled off
  - Timer uses exercise's restPeriod from current exercise
- **Files created/changed:**
  - Modified: `src/app/components/RestPeriodIndicator.tsx` (added autoStart prop and effect)
  - Modified: `src/app/workout/[id]/page.tsx` (added timer state, trigger, and rendering)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use key prop to force re-mount of timer component for fresh countdown
  - useCallback for trigger function to avoid re-renders in dependency arrays
  - Animate-in classes from Tailwind: `animate-in fade-in slide-in-from-top-2 duration-300`
  - Effect with `[autoStart, restPeriod, timeRemaining]` deps handles auto-start on mount only

  - html2canvas options: `backgroundColor`, `scale`, `useCORS`, `logging` are valid
  - Web Share API `navigator.canShare()` checks if file sharing is supported
  - Pattern for generating shareable images: useRef on card div + html2canvas + toBlob
  - Existing share cards in `src/components/share/` (AchievementCard, ProgramCard) for reference
---

## 2026-01-10 18:XX - US-011: Add share prompt after workout completion
- **What was implemented:**

---

## 2026-01-10 19:XX - US-014: Create progress photo comparison component
- **What was implemented:**
  - Created new PhotoComparison component at `src/components/progress/PhotoComparison.tsx`

  - Photo type tabs (Front, Back, Left Side, Right Side)
  - Auto-selects first and last check-ins with photos
  - Fetches photos from `/api/programs/[programId]/progress-photos/compare`
  - Datalist hints for available dates with check-in photos
- **Files created/changed:**
  - Created: `src/components/progress/PhotoComparison.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Existing `PhotoComparison.tsx` at `src/components/` is used by dashboard modal - more feature-rich (slider view)
  - New component in `progress/` folder is simpler, focused on date picker UX per story requirements
  - Memoize array extractions from optional chaining to avoid useMemo dependency warnings
  - Pattern: `useMemo(() => checkIn?.photos || [], [checkIn])` instead of direct `checkIn?.photos || []`
  - Native HTML datalist provides date hints but doesn't restrict input
---

## 2026-01-10 19:XX - US-015: Add photo comparison view to check-in history
- **What was implemented:**
  - Added Check-in History section to the `/check-in` page below the form

  - Button opens existing PhotoComparison modal component with programId
  - Shows loading state while fetching, empty state when no photos
  - Each check-in row shows date and photo count
- **Files created/changed:**
  - Modified: `src/app/check-in/page.tsx` (added history section, PhotoComparison modal integration, fetch logic)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `/api/programs/latest` endpoint returns current program for the user
  - Reuse existing PhotoComparison component from `src/components/` - it already handles date selection and defaults to first/last check-ins
  - Pattern for conditional modal: `{programId && <PhotoComparison programId={programId} isOpen={...} />}`
  - Check-in page didn't have a "history" view previously - this adds visibility into past check-ins
---

  - Modal receives meal context (name, type) and ingredient for contextual swap suggestions
- **Files created/changed:**
  - Modified: `src/app/meal-prep/components/MealPlanDisplay.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - MealCard is defined inside MealPlanDisplay.tsx, not a separate file
  - Added SwapModalState interface to track: isOpen, ingredient, mealName, mealType, dayIndex, mealIndex
  - DayCard now receives dayIndex and onIngredientClick callback to bubble up to parent
  - Upgrade toast pattern: absolute positioned banner with animate-in classes, auto-dismiss with setTimeout
  - e.stopPropagation() on ingredient click prevents collapse/expand toggle from firing
