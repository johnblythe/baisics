## 2026-01-18 - US-001: Rename /import to /create
- Moved src/app/import/ directory to src/app/create/
- Updated layout.tsx metadata title from 'Import Your Workout Program | BAIsics' to 'Create Your Program | baisics'
- Updated OpenGraph title to match
- Renamed layout function from ImportLayout to CreateLayout
- Updated callback URL in page.tsx from '/import?complete=true' to '/create?complete=true'
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Next.js App Router uses directory names as routes - renaming directory automatically changes route
  - API routes at /api/programs/import remain unchanged (different concern)
  - sessionStorage callback URLs need updating when routes change

## 2026-01-18 - US-002: Update /tools/import-program redirect
- Changed redirect from '/import' to '/create' in src/app/tools/import-program/page.tsx
- Updated metadata title to 'Create Your Workout Program | baisics' (lowercase 'baisics' per style guide)
- Updated metadata description to mention creating programs, not just importing
- Updated OpenGraph title and description to match
- Files changed: src/app/tools/import-program/page.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - This route exists as a legacy URL for SEO/bookmarks - redirects to new /create route
  - Keep metadata updated even on redirect pages for search engine discovery
  - Style guide specifies lowercase 'baisics' in titles
