## 2026-01-18 - US-001: Rename /import to /create
- Moved src/app/import/ directory to src/app/create/
- Updated layout.tsx metadata title from 'Import Your Workout Program | BAIsics' to 'Create Your Program | baisics'
- Updated OpenGraph title to match
- Renamed layout function from ImportLayout to CreateLayout
- Updated callback URL in page.tsx from '/import?complete=true' to '/create?complete=true'
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Next.js App Router uses directory names as routes - renaming directory automatically changes route
  - API routes at /api/programs/import remain unchanged (different concern)
  - sessionStorage callback URLs need updating when routes change

## 2026-01-18 - US-002: Update /tools/import-program redirect
- Changed redirect from '/import' to '/create' in src/app/tools/import-program/page.tsx
- Updated metadata title to 'Create Your Workout Program | baisics' (lowercase 'baisics' per style guide)
- Updated metadata description to mention creating programs, not just importing
- Updated OpenGraph title and description to match
- Files changed: src/app/tools/import-program/page.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - This route exists as a legacy URL for SEO/bookmarks - redirects to new /create route
  - Keep metadata updated even on redirect pages for search engine discovery
  - Style guide specifies lowercase 'baisics' in titles

## 2026-01-18 - US-003: Add text input mode to /create
- Added inputMode state ('text' | 'file') defaulting to 'text'
- Added textInput state to hold pasted text content
- Created toggle UI with two tabs: "Paste Text" and "Upload File"
- Text mode shows a textarea with example placeholder showing workout format
- File mode shows existing dropzone UI
- Added processText() function to send text to API
- Added handleTextSubmit() to process text input
- Updated handleStartOver() to clear text input
- Bulk mode toggle only shows when in file mode (coaches only)
- Updated page description to mention both text and file options
- Files changed: src/app/create/page.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Type icon imported from lucide-react for text input toggle
  - API needs US-004 update to actually accept the text field - frontend is ready
  - Bulk import (coaches) only makes sense for file mode, so hidden in text mode
