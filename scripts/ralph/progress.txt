## Codebase Patterns

### Achievement/Badge Patterns
- Use framer-motion for animations (already in project)
- Use react-confetti for celebration effects (already in project)
- Share functionality: Native share API, Twitter/X integration, copy-to-clipboard
- Modal pattern: Full-screen overlay with backdrop-blur-sm, rounded-2xl cards
- Color gradient pattern: `bg-gradient-to-br from-[color1] to-[color2]`

### API Pattern
- Auth: Use `auth()` from `@/auth` for API routes (not getServerSession)
- Error handling: Return NextResponse.json with status codes
- Prisma: Use `@/lib/prisma` singleton

### Component Patterns
- Use `'use client'` directive for client components
- Wrap useSearchParams in Suspense boundary (Next.js 15 requirement)
- MainLayout wrapper for authenticated pages
- Brand colors: #FF6B6B (coral), #0F172A (navy), #F8FAFC (bg)

## 2026-01-16 11:XX - US-001: Lifetime Milestone Badges System
- What was implemented:
  - MilestoneType enum + MilestoneAchievement model in Prisma
  - Database migration for milestone_achievements table
  - MilestoneBadge component with earned/locked visual states
  - MilestoneBadgeGrid component showing all badges with progress bar
  - MilestoneCelebrationModal with confetti, journey display, share options
  - /achievements page showing all badges, stats summary, progress to next
  - /api/milestones endpoint to fetch user milestones and stats
  - Integration into workout completion API to check/award milestones
  - /share/milestone page for social sharing with OG metadata
  - /api/og/milestone edge function for OG image generation

- Files created:
  - prisma/migrations/20260116105341_add_milestone_achievements/migration.sql
  - src/lib/milestones.ts (config + helper functions)
  - src/lib/milestone-service.ts (check/award logic)
  - src/components/milestones/MilestoneBadge.tsx
  - src/components/milestones/MilestoneCelebrationModal.tsx
  - src/components/milestones/index.ts
  - src/app/achievements/page.tsx
  - src/app/api/milestones/route.ts
  - src/app/share/milestone/page.tsx
  - src/app/api/og/milestone/route.tsx

- Files modified:
  - prisma/schema.prisma (added MilestoneType enum, MilestoneAchievement model, User relation)
  - src/app/api/workout-logs/[id]/complete/route.ts (added milestone check)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - useSearchParams requires Suspense wrapper in Next.js 15 for static generation
  - API routes use `auth()` not `getServerSession(authOptions)`
  - OG image routes should use `runtime = 'edge'` for performance
  - Milestone thresholds: 1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 365, 500, 1000
  - Volume calculation: sum of (weight * reps) from all completed SetLogs

## 2026-01-16 12:XX - US-002: Rest Day Affirmation Screen
- What was implemented:
  - REST API endpoint `/api/programs/[programId]/rest-day` for rest day detection
  - Rest day detection logic: completed weekly target OR already worked out today
  - RestDayDashboard component with calmer visual design (gray/slate tones)
  - Weekly progress ring showing X/Y workouts with animated SVG
  - Lifetime stats display: total workouts, total volume, current streak
  - Rotating educational coaching tips (5 recovery tips based on day of year)
  - Optional activity logging: nutrition, stretching, foam rolling (zero-pressure)
  - "Go HAM" option to start workout anyway on rest days
  - Weekly schedule indicator with [R] markers for rest days
  - Dashboard integration: shows RestDayDashboard when isRestDay=true, hides workout card

- Files created:
  - src/app/api/programs/[programId]/rest-day/route.ts (detection + stats API)
  - src/components/rest-day/RestDayDashboard.tsx (main component)
  - src/components/rest-day/index.ts (barrel export)

- Files modified:
  - src/app/dashboard/[programId]/page.tsx (import, state, fetch, conditional render)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Rest day detection uses simple logic: weekly completed >= weekly target OR worked out today
  - WorkoutPlan has `daysPerWeek` field for determining weekly target
  - Recovery tips rotate based on day of year modulo tip count
  - formatVolume helper exists in src/lib/milestones.ts for displaying volume
  - Conditional dashboard rendering: show rest day OR workout card (not both)
  - Activity logging is client-side only for now (could add API endpoint later)

- What was implemented:
  - Added `quickLog` and `quickLogExpiry` fields to WorkoutLog Prisma model
  - Database migration for new quick_log fields
  - `/api/workout-logs/quick-log` API endpoint for quick logging workouts
  - QuickLogButton component with framer-motion animations
  - Multi-state button: idle -> confirming -> loading -> success/error
  - Integrated into dashboard alongside "Start Workout" button
  - Updates streak and milestone tracking on quick log

- Files created:
  - prisma/migrations/20260116130000_add_quick_log_fields/migration.sql
  - src/app/api/workout-logs/quick-log/route.ts
  - src/components/quick-log/QuickLogButton.tsx
  - src/components/quick-log/index.ts

- Files modified:
  - prisma/schema.prisma (added quickLog, quickLogExpiry fields to WorkoutLog)
  - src/app/dashboard/[programId]/page.tsx (import + integration of QuickLogButton)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Quick log creates WorkoutLog with status='completed' immediately (no exercise logs)
  - 48-hour expiry stored for potential backfill feature
  - Button pattern: idle state, confirm step, loading, success animation
  - Use framer-motion AnimatePresence with mode="wait" for smooth state transitions
  - API reuses existing updateStreak and checkAndAwardMilestone helpers

## 2026-01-16 14:XX - US-004: First Workout Celebration
- What was implemented:
  - FirstWorkoutCelebration component with full-screen celebration experience
  - Tasteful confetti animation (2-3 seconds, then stops)
  - Day One badge display using existing MilestoneBadge component
  - Animated workout stats counter (sets completed, total volume)
  - Share functionality: native share, Twitter/X, copy-to-clipboard
  - Auto-advance countdown (5 seconds) - pauses on user interaction
  - Detection via `isFirstWorkout` flag in workout completion API response
  - Workout stats calculation in completion API (setsCompleted, totalVolume)

  - src/app/workout/[id]/page.tsx (import, state, conditional render for first workout)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - First workout detection: milestone type 'WORKOUT_1' just unlocked
  - Auto-advance pattern: useEffect with interval, cancel on user interaction
  - Stats animation: requestAnimationFrame with easing function for smooth counting
  - Reuse existing MilestoneBadge component - don't create duplicate badge components
  - workout completion API now returns: isFirstWorkout, workoutStats, streak, milestone

## 2026-01-16 15:XX - US-005: Completion Ring + Weekly Progress
- What was implemented:
  - CompletionRing component with SVG animated fill using framer-motion
  - WeeklyDayIndicators component showing day-by-day status
  - WeeklyDayLegend component explaining indicator meanings
  - WeeklyProgressCard component combining ring + indicators
  - Enhanced rest-day API with per-day status calculation
  - Dashboard integration with split view layout (ring left, workout card right)
  - Copy variants based on progress: "Fresh week", "Off to a good start", etc.
  - Accessibility: aria-label with "X of Y workouts completed this week"

- Files created:

  - src/components/rest-day/RestDayDashboard.tsx (updated to use WeeklyDayIndicators, added DayInfo type)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - SVG ring animation: use strokeDasharray/strokeDashoffset for progress fill
  - Per-day status logic considers: completed workouts this week, expected workout days based on daysPerWeek
  - Expected workout days heuristic: 3-day = Mon/Wed/Fri, 4-day = Mon/Tue/Thu/Fri, etc.
  - Desktop split view: lg:flex-row with lg:w-1/3 for ring section
  - Mobile: stacked layout with ring centered above fold
  - Don't shame users for missed days - show as 'scheduled' not 'missed' to be kind

## 2026-01-16 16:XX - US-006: Missed Workout Recovery Flow
- What was implemented:
  - `/api/programs/[programId]/recovery` API endpoint for detecting missed workouts
  - Two-tier recovery messaging: "Welcome back" (1-2 days) vs "No judgment" (3+ days)
  - RecoveryScreen modal component with supportive messaging
  - Lifetime stats display: total workouts, volume lifted, program progress %
  - Three workout options: Today's Workout (full), Quick Comeback (3 exercises), Not Today

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Recovery detection: daysSinceLastWorkout >= 1 AND not a rest day
  - Quick Comeback prefers compound exercises from ExerciseLibrary.isCompound field
  - Session-based dismissal uses sessionStorage with programId key
  - useCallback hooks must be called before any early returns (React rules of hooks)
  - Analytics uses AppLog table with category='recovery_flow' for tracking
  - Two recovery tiers based on daysSinceLastWorkout threshold (< 3 vs >= 3)
