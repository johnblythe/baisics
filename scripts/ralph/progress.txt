## Codebase Patterns

- **Workout components location**: Create new workout components in `src/components/workout/`
- **Design reference**: Option B from `/dev/workout-tracker` is the approved design
- **Style tokens**: Use coral (#FF6B6B, #EF5350), light coral (#FFE5E5), and green-100/300 for completed states
- **Component patterns**: Export named functions (not default), include 'use client' directive for client components

## 2026-01-10 - US-004: Add progress bar component for workout completion
- Created `src/components/workout/WorkoutProgressBar.tsx`
- Horizontal progress bar with coral gradient fill (from-[#FF6B6B] to-[#EF5350])
- Completion count text displayed next to bar (e.g., '2/4')
- Bar container: bg-[#F1F5F9] rounded-full
- Width transitions smoothly with transition-all
- Props: completedCount (number), totalCount (number)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Reference design is lines 202-211 in `/dev/workout-tracker/page.tsx` (OptionBHybrid)
  - Use inline style for dynamic width percentage, Tailwind for static styling
  - Simple component, no icons needed
---

## 2026-01-10 14:XX - US-001: Create SetProgressGrid component for workout tracker
- Created `src/components/workout/SetProgressGrid.tsx`
- Grid layout with 4 columns showing set progress
- Completed sets: green-100 bg, green-300 border, checkmark badge
- Active/selected set: coral highlight with ring-2 ring-offset-2
- Pending sets: clickable gray cells
- Props: logs (SetLog[]), activeIndex, selectedIndex, onSelect callback
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `/dev/workout-tracker` page shows all design options - Option B is "hybrid" approach
  - lucide-react already installed, use for icons (CheckCircle, etc.)
  - Component follows 4-column grid matching typical 4-set exercises
---

## 2026-01-10 - US-002: Create BigSetInputCard component with coral gradient
- Created `src/components/workout/BigSetInputCard.tsx`
- Big touch-friendly coral gradient card (from-[#FF6B6B] to-[#EF5350])
- Shows set number (text-3xl font-bold) and target reps
- Large inputs with white/20 bg and text-xl font-bold styling
- Complete Set button: white bg, coral text, py-4, full width
- Props: setNumber, targetReps, weight, reps, onWeightChange, onRepsChange, onComplete
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Reference design is lines 213-250 in `/dev/workout-tracker/page.tsx` (OptionBHybrid)
  - Input styling uses bg-white/20 border-white/30 for translucent effect on gradient
  - Button has active:scale-[0.98] for tactile feedback on mobile
---

## 2026-01-10 - US-003: Create RestTimerControl component with auto-start toggle
- Created `src/components/workout/RestTimerControl.tsx`
- White card with coral-tinted clock icon (w-10 h-10 bg-[#FFE5E5])
- Shows "Rest Timer" label with rest duration text below
- Auto-start toggle using styled peer checkbox pattern
- Toggle is coral (#FF6B6B) when checked
- Props: restDuration (string), autoStart (boolean), onAutoStartChange (callback)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Reference design is lines 252-270 in `/dev/workout-tracker/page.tsx` (OptionBHybrid)
  - Toggle pattern: sr-only input + sibling div with peer-checked styling
  - Use peer-focus:ring for accessibility on toggle
---

## 2026-01-10 - US-005: Integrate new workout tracker components into workout page
- Modified `src/app/workout/[id]/page.tsx` to use new redesigned components
- Imported SetProgressGrid, BigSetInputCard, RestTimerControl, WorkoutProgressBar
- Added `selectedSetIndex` state to track which set is selected in the grid
- Added `autoStartTimer` state to control rest timer auto-start preference
- Replaced old SetInput-based UI with new component layout:
  - SetProgressGrid at top showing 4-column set overview
  - WorkoutProgressBar showing exercise-level progress
  - BigSetInputCard for logging current/selected set
  - RestTimerControl at bottom with auto-start toggle
- Added helper function `formatRestDuration()` to format seconds as "M:SS"
- Reset selectedSetIndex when navigating between exercises (prev/next buttons and quick nav)
- Shows completion state when all sets are done instead of input card
- Kept old SetInput component in file for backwards compatibility (not rendered)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Page has complex state management with exercises array containing logs
  - Grid needs SetLog type matching but page uses slightly different interface (optional weight)
  - Need to handle "all sets completed" edge case gracefully
  - Exercise navigation resets selection state to avoid stale selectedIndex
  - The old SetInput component is still defined in file - could be removed in cleanup story

## 2026-01-10 - US-006: Update ProgramCard header with gradient fade styling
- Modified `src/app/components/ProgramCard.tsx`
- Changed header gradient from 'to bottom right' to 180deg vertical
- Gradient stops: #0F172A at 0%, #1E293B at 60%, #334155 at 100%
- Added `navyMid: '#334155'` and `descriptionText: '#CBD5E1'` to COLORS
- Description text uses #CBD5E1 for better contrast on gradient
- Category badge changed from bg-white/20 to border-white/30 with text-white/90
- Updated both card variants (CardContent for user's program, Link wrapper for templates)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ProgramCard has two rendering paths: CardContent (for user's programs with Link wrapper) and a separate template in the return for non-user cards
  - Reference design is `/dev/library-cards` Option D (OptionDGradient function)
  - US-007 will add overlapping stats to header - requires negative margin (-mb-8) and pt-12 on body
  - US-008 will change goals to coral badges and CTA to gradient button
---

## 2026-01-10 - US-007: Add elevated overlapping stats to ProgramCard
- Modified `src/app/components/ProgramCard.tsx`
- Stats section moved inside header div with negative margin (-mb-8) and relative z-10
- Stats now appear as white cards with shadow-lg and border border-[#E2E8F0]
- Stats use flex gap-4 layout horizontally instead of grid
- Each stat card: flex-1 text-center py-3 rounded-lg bg-white shadow-lg
- Body content gets pt-12 padding to accommodate overlap
- Body background changes to #FAFAFA
- Stats show only Days/Week and Weeks (removed cloneCount from overlap section)
- Updated both card variants (CardContent and template Link variant)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Reference design is `/dev/library-cards` Option D lines 218-228
  - Overlapping stats pattern: place inside header, use -mb-8 on stats container, pt-12 on body
  - Use gray600 (#64748B) for stat labels instead of gray400 for better contrast on white cards
  - Border uses COLORS.gray100 (#F1F5F9) for subtle definition
