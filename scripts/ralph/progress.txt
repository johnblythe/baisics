## 2026-01-15 20:25 - US-001: Create dev page scaffold for rest day prototypes
- Created src/app/dev/rest-day/page.tsx with toggle buttons for Options A-F
- Added rest-day entry to DEV_PAGES array in src/app/dev/page.tsx
- Page uses dark bg (#0F172A) with coral accents (#FF6B6B) matching other dev pages
- Created components subdirectory for future option components
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Dev pages follow consistent pattern: dark background, coral accents, toggle selector, description panel
  - Look at src/app/dev/exercise-cards/page.tsx for full component example with options
  - Options are labeled with short names (Zen, Celebrate, Active, Coach, Game, Social)
  - Component preview area uses light bg (#F8FAFC) for contrast

## 2026-01-15 20:45 - US-002: Option A: Minimal zen rest card
- Created src/app/dev/rest-day/components/RestDayOptionA.tsx
- Design: Calm white/light gradient card, moon icon, minimal text
- Shows: "Rest Day" title, encouraging message ("Your body grows stronger during rest"), next workout preview
- Added subtle "Preview next workout" CTA
- Updated page.tsx to import and render Option A component
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Rest day components receive `nextWorkout` prop with `name` and `dayOfWeek`
  - Use subtle gradients (white → gray-50 → gray-100) for calm feel
  - Preview area renders conditionally based on `activeOption` state
  - SVG icons from heroicons work well, use low opacity for zen aesthetic

## 2026-01-15 21:05 - US-003: Option B: Achievement celebration card
- Created src/app/dev/rest-day/components/RestDayOptionB.tsx
- Design: Warm orange gradient card with trophy icon and sparkle animations
- Shows: "You crushed it!" message, progress ring (3/4 workouts), streak display (7 days)
- Progress ring uses SVG with animated stroke-dashoffset for smooth appearance
- Next workout teaser with "Preview →" button
- Updated page.tsx to import and render Option B with mock data
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - SVG progress rings: circumference = 2 * PI * radius, use strokeDashoffset for fill animation
  - Props pattern: workoutsCompleted, weeklyTarget, streak, nextWorkout
  - Orange warm palette: #FFF7ED → #FFEDD5 → #FED7AA gradients, #F97316 accents
  - Ping animation creates subtle celebration effect with multiple offset dots

## 2026-01-15 21:30 - US-004: Option C: Active recovery suggestions card
- Created src/app/dev/rest-day/components/RestDayOptionC.tsx
- Design: Green gradient card with heart icon, 3 tappable activity tiles
- Options: "Log Nutrition" (yellow), "Light Stretch" (purple, locked/premium), "Train Anyway" (blue)
- Premium badge on locked option with lock icon, dashed border indicates unavailable
- Emphasized "optional" messaging - rest is totally fine
- Next workout preview at bottom
- Updated page.tsx to import and render Option C
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Green palette: #F0FDF4 → #DCFCE7 → #BBF7D0 gradients, #22C55E accents, #166534 text
  - Premium/locked features: use dashed border, reduced opacity, "Premium" badge, lock icon
  - Activity tiles pattern: icon box (gradient bg) + text + chevron, hover states

## 2026-01-15 21:55 - US-005: Option D: Coach wisdom card
- Created src/app/dev/rest-day/components/RestDayOptionD.tsx
- Design: Purple gradient card with lightbulb icon, rotating recovery tips
- 5 science-backed tips with source attributions (sleep, hydration, active recovery, protein synthesis, muscle growth)
- Tips rotate based on day of week for consistency across sessions
- Each tip has a contextual icon (moon for sleep, heart for active recovery, etc.)
- Subtle reassuring message: "Your body is recovering and getting stronger today"
- Next workout preview at bottom
- Updated page.tsx to import and render Option D
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Purple palette: #F5F3FF → #EDE9FE → #DDD6FE gradients, #8B5CF6/#7C3AED accents, #5B21B6 text
  - Rotating content: use `new Date().getDay() % array.length` for day-based "random" selection
  - Props pattern for all rest day components: `nextWorkout?: { name: string; dayOfWeek: string }`
  - Icon component with switch statement keeps SVGs organized in one place

## 2026-01-15 22:30 - US-006: Option E: Gamified rest card
- Created src/app/dev/rest-day/components/RestDayOptionE.tsx
- Design: Fuchsia/purple gradient card with star badge, gamification elements
- Shows: "Recovery Mission" badge with +50 XP reward overlay
- Progress bar: "Recovery Progress" fills based on hours elapsed (0-24)
- Streak display with "Includes rest" badge showing rest protects streak
- Mini badges earned today: Rest Champion, Recovery Master, Streak Shield
- Next workout preview at bottom with "+100 XP" reward teaser
- Updated page.tsx to import and render Option E with mock data (streak=7, restDayXP=50)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Fuchsia palette: #FDF4FF → #FAE8FF → #F5D0FE gradients, #A855F7/#D946EF accents, #86198F text
  - Props pattern: streak, restDayXP, nextWorkout
  - Time-based progress: use `new Date().getHours() + new Date().getMinutes() / 60` for smooth calc
  - Badge row with gradient backgrounds creates visual reward collection
  - Subtle rotate transform on hover adds playfulness without being annoying
  - Yellow accents (#FEF08A → #FDE047) work well for XP/reward elements

## 2026-01-15 23:00 - US-007: Option F: Social proof card
- Created src/app/dev/rest-day/components/RestDayOptionF.tsx
- Design: Cyan/teal gradient card with community icon, social proof elements
- Shows: "2,847 others are resting today" with avatar stack
- Avatar stack: 6 anonymous gradient avatars + "+Xk" indicator
- Top performers insight: "Top performers rest 2x per week"
- Reassuring message: "Smart athletes prioritize recovery"
- Next workout preview at bottom
- Updated page.tsx to import and render Option F with mock data
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Cyan/teal palette: #ECFEFF → #CFFAFE → #A5F3FC gradients, #22D3EE/#06B6D4 accents, #0E7490 text
  - Props pattern: othersResting, topPerformerRestDays, nextWorkout
  - Avatar stack: use -space-x-3 for overlapping, z-index for stacking order
  - Social proof messaging: normalize the behavior ("others are doing it"), cite authority ("top performers")
  - Number formatting: use .toLocaleString() for thousands separators (2,847 not 2847)

## 2026-01-15 23:30 - US-008: Wire up all options with toggle
- Verified all 6 options (A-F) are imported and wired up in page.tsx
- Toggle buttons show correctly: A (Zen), B (Celebrate), C (Active), D (Coach), E (Game), F (Social)
- Mock data in place: workoutsThisWeek=3, weeklyTarget=4, nextWorkout='Legs', streak=7
- Responsive grid: 3 columns mobile, 6 columns desktop (grid-cols-3 sm:grid-cols-6)
- npm run lint passes (only pre-existing warnings from other files)
- npm run build passes successfully (page builds at 6.86 kB)
- All 6 options render without errors
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Each story (US-002 through US-007) incrementally added its component AND wired it into page.tsx
  - Final assembly story (US-008) was mostly complete by the time we got here
  - Always verify final state before marking complete - work may have been done incrementally
  - Props consistency across all options: nextWorkout={ name, dayOfWeek } is the common pattern
