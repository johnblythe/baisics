US-006 is complete. Let me check if there are more stories to complete:

Looking at the PRD, remaining stories with `passes: false`:
- US-007: Add transition error handling to ProgramBuilder
- US-008: Create competitor comparison blog template  
- US-009: Write baisics vs Trainerize comparison post
- US-010: Final verification and build check

There are still stories with `passes: false`, so another iteration will continue. I've completed US-006 for this iteration.

**Summary of US-006 completion:**
- Added Prisma error type imports
- Enhanced error handling with specific messages for Prisma errors (P2002, P2003, P2025)
- Added handling for PrismaClientValidationError
- All quality checks pass (TypeScript, lint, build)
- Committed with message: `feat: US-006 - Improve error handling in program create actions`
