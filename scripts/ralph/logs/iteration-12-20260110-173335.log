- Optional before/after photo slots with side-by-side layout
- Privacy toggles to blur stats or hide photos
- Branded styling matching WorkoutShareCard (coral gradient header, navy background)
- Uses html2canvas for PNG generation, Web Share API for mobile sharing
- Lint and build pass, committed as `feat: US-012 - Create progress share card component`
