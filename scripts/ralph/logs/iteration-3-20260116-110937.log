US-001, US-002, and US-003 are complete (`passes: true`). There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-004 through US-009), so another iteration will pick up the next story.

**Summary of US-003 Implementation:**

Implemented the "Quick Log - I Did It Button" feature:

1. **Schema Changes:**
   - Added `quickLog` boolean field to WorkoutLog model
   - Added `quickLogExpiry` timestamp for 48-hour backfill window

2. **API Endpoint:**
   - Created `/api/workout-logs/quick-log` POST endpoint
   - Creates completed WorkoutLog immediately without exercise details
   - Updates streak and checks for milestone achievements

3. **UI Component:**
   - Created QuickLogButton component with framer-motion animations
   - Multi-state flow: idle → confirming → loading → success/error
   - Visual checkmark animation on successful log

4. **Dashboard Integration:**
   - Added QuickLogButton alongside "Start Workout" button
   - Refreshes dashboard data on successful quick log
