There are still 2 stories with `passes: false` (US-023 and US-024). My iteration is complete - another iteration will pick up the next story.

**Summary of US-022 completion:**

- Created `src/content/blog/_templates/competitor-comparison-template.tsx` - A comprehensive blog template for competitor comparison posts with:
  - Quick comparison table section
  - "What is [Competitor]?" section
  - "What is Baisics?" section
  - Pricing comparison section
  - Feature deep dive section
  - Decision framework ("Choose X if...")
  - CTA section
  - FAQ section (optional)
  - SEO-optimized frontmatter with placeholder keywords

- Created `src/content/blog/_templates/README.md` with usage guidelines and writing tips

- Fixed `src/app/blog/page.tsx` to filter out folders starting with `_` or `.` from the blog post listing
