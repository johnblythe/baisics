**US-002 Complete: Create /share/workout route**

Created a public workout share page at `/share/workout` that:
- Parses the `date` query param from URLs like `/share/workout?date=2026-01-07T17:00:00.000Z`
- Shows a "Workout Completed!" message with the formatted date when valid
- Shows a friendly "Link Not Found" error when date is missing/invalid  
- Uses v2a design system (coral gradient header, navy text, Outfit/Space Mono fonts)
- Includes CTAs to sign up via `/hi`
- No auth required - fully public page
