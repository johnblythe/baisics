There are still 11 stories with `passes: false`. US-013 is complete. The iteration has finished successfully.

**Summary of US-013 implementation:**

- Added `ProgressShareCard` import to the dashboard page
- Added `isProgressShareModalOpen` state and wired it into the existing modal URL system
- Added a "Share Progress" button to the stats card in the dashboard (only shows when workouts > 0)
- Button uses coral gradient styling matching v2a design system
- Modal opens with computed progress data (weeks, workouts, weight change, photos)
- All share functionality (Twitter, Copy, Download) comes from the existing ProgressShareCard component
