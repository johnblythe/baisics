**US-017 Complete.** I've implemented the ingredient swap suggestions API endpoint.

**Summary:**
- Created `POST /api/nutrition/swap-suggestions` endpoint
- Uses Claude Haiku for fast AI-generated contextual swap suggestions
- Accepts ingredient info, meal context, and user goals
- Returns 3-4 suggestions with macro deltas (protein, carbs, fat, calories) and reasons
- Rate limited to 10 requests per minute
- Requires premium subscription (returns 403 for free tier users)
- Lint and build pass

There are still stories with `passes: false` remaining (US-018 through US-024), so another iteration will pick up the next story.
