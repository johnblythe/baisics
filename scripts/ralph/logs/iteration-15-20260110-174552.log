There are still 9 stories with `passes: false`. My iteration is complete. 

**Summary of US-015 implementation:**

- Added a "Check-in History" section to the `/check-in` page that displays past check-ins with photos
- Added a "Compare Photos" button with coral gradient styling (appears only when 2+ check-ins with photos exist)
- Button opens the existing `PhotoComparison` modal component which already:
  - Defaults to first and most recent check-ins with photos
  - Allows changing date selection via dropdown
  - Supports side-by-side and slider view modes
  - Has photo type tabs (Front, Back, Left Side, Right Side)
- All quality checks (lint, build) pass
- Changes committed
