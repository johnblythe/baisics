US-001 is complete. There are still stories with `passes: false`, so I'll stop here for this iteration.

**US-001 Complete:** Created the rest day dev page scaffold at `/dev/rest-day` with:
- Toggle buttons for Options A-F (Zen, Celebrate, Active, Coach, Game, Social)
- Dark background with coral accents matching other dev pages
- Added entry to DEV_PAGES array
- Lint and build pass
- Committed as `feat: US-001 - Create dev page scaffold for rest day prototypes`

Next story to implement: **US-002** - Option A: Minimal zen rest card
