There are still 7 stories with `passes: false` (US-003 through US-009). My task was to complete ONE story per iteration, and I have completed US-002.

**Summary of US-002 Implementation:**

## US-002: Rest Day Affirmation Screen - COMPLETE

**What was implemented:**
1. **REST API endpoint** `/api/programs/[programId]/rest-day` - Detects rest days and returns:
   - `isRestDay` flag based on weekly workout completion or same-day workout
   - Weekly progress stats (completed/target/percent)
   - Lifetime stats (total workouts, volume, streak)
   - Next workout info
   - Rotating educational recovery tip

2. **RestDayDashboard component** with:
   - Calmer visual design (gray/slate gradient backgrounds, less saturated)
   - Weekly progress ring (SVG with animated stroke)
   - Lifetime stats display (total workouts, volume lifted, streak badge)
   - Educational coaching content that rotates daily (5 recovery tips)
   - Optional activity logging buttons (nutrition, stretching, foam rolling) - zero pressure
   - "Go HAM" option to start a workout anyway
   - Weekly schedule indicator with [R] markers for rest days

3. **Dashboard integration** - When `restDayData.isRestDay` is true, shows RestDayDashboard instead of the workout start card

**Files created:**
- `src/app/api/programs/[programId]/rest-day/route.ts`
- `src/components/rest-day/RestDayDashboard.tsx`
- `src/components/rest-day/index.ts`

**Files modified:**
- `src/app/dashboard/[programId]/page.tsx` (integrated rest day detection)
- `scripts/ralph/prd.json` (marked US-002 as passes: true)
- `scripts/ralph/progress.txt` (added implementation notes)
