US-004 is complete. Let me check the remaining stories:

- US-005: Fix template page header auth state - `passes: false`
- US-006: Improve progress photos UX - `passes: false`
- US-007: Fix PhotoComparison Image error - `passes: false`
- US-008: Final verification - `passes: false`

There are still stories with `passes: false`, so another iteration will pick up the next story.

**Summary of US-004 completion:**

- Added `getFallbackSuggestions()` function with category-based ingredient swap suggestions covering proteins, dairy, carbs, oils/fats, sugars, and vegetables
- Updated error handling to gracefully fall back to hardcoded suggestions when:
  - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is missing
  - AI response parsing fails
  - Any AI call errors occur
- Each fallback returns 3 reasonable alternatives with realistic macro deltas
- Improved error logging for debugging while returning useful data to users
- Build and lint pass successfully
