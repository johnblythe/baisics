There are still 4 stories with `passes: false` (US-006, US-007, US-008, US-009). The iteration is complete for US-005.

**Summary of US-005 Implementation:**

## Completed: US-005 - Completion Ring + Weekly Progress

**What was implemented:**
1. **CompletionRing component** (`src/components/weekly-progress/CompletionRing.tsx`)
   - SVG ring with framer-motion animated fill
   - Shows "X of Y workouts this week" in center
   - Progress messages based on state: "Fresh week", "Off to a good start", "Halfway there", etc.
   - Navy stroke (#E2E8F0 background), coral fill (#FF6B6B)
   - Accessibility: aria-label announces progress

2. **WeeklyDayIndicators component** (`src/components/weekly-progress/WeeklyDayIndicators.tsx`)
   - Day-by-day status display: [check] completed, [arrow] today, [R] rest, [·] scheduled
   - Animated entrance with framer-motion
   - WeeklyDayLegend component for explaining indicators

3. **Enhanced rest-day API** (`src/app/api/programs/[programId]/rest-day/route.ts`)
   - Added `days` array with per-day status calculation
   - Logic for expected workout days based on `daysPerWeek` (3-day = Mon/Wed/Fri, etc.)
   - Kind approach: doesn't shame users for missed days

4. **Dashboard integration** (`src/app/dashboard/[programId]/page.tsx`)
   - Split view layout: ring left (1/3), workout card right (2/3) on desktop
   - Mobile: stacked layout with ring centered above fold
   - Integrates with existing rest-day data

**All acceptance criteria met:**
- ✅ SVG ring with animated fill
- ✅ Shows X of Y workouts in center
- ✅ Day indicators with proper status
- ✅ Weekly framing (protects rest days)
- ✅ Brand colors (coral fill, navy accents)
- ✅ Desktop split view layout
