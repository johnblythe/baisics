**US-001 completed successfully.**

Summary:
- Created a new `CalendarPicker` component with v2a styling (coral #FF6B6B for selected day, navy text)
- Replaced the intermediate date input with a direct calendar dropdown
- Calendar prevents selecting future dates
- Closes on date selection, click outside, or Escape key
- Includes "Today" quick button
- Build and lint pass

There are still stories with `passes: false` in the PRD (US-002 through US-008), so another iteration will pick up the next story.
