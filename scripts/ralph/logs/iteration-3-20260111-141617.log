US-003 is complete. Let me check if there are remaining stories with `passes: false`:

Looking at the PRD:
- US-001: passes: true ✓
- US-002: passes: true ✓
- US-003: passes: true ✓ (just completed)
- US-004: passes: false (Fix swap suggestions API)
- US-005: passes: false (Fix template page header auth state)
- US-006: passes: false (Improve progress photos UX)
- US-007: passes: false (Fix PhotoComparison Image error)
- US-008: passes: false (Final verification)

There are still stories with `passes: false`, so I'll end my response normally for the next iteration to continue.
