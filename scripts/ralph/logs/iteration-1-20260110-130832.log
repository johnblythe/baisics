US-001 is complete. There are still more stories with `passes: false` (US-002 through US-014), so I'm ending this iteration here. The next iteration will pick up US-002 (BigSetInputCard component).

**Summary of completed work:**
- Created `src/components/workout/SetProgressGrid.tsx` with:
  - 4-column grid layout for set progress visualization
  - Green styling for completed sets with checkmark badges
  - Coral highlight for active/selected sets
  - Clickable pending sets with hover states
  - Proper TypeScript types and props interface
- All quality checks passed (typecheck, lint, build)
- Committed changes and updated PRD to mark US-001 as complete
- Updated progress.txt with learnings for future iterations
