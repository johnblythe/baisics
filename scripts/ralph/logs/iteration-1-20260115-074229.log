US-001 is complete. There are still stories with `passes: false`, so I'll end here for this iteration.

**Completed:** US-001 - Fix parse API prompt to allow macros without calories

**Summary:**
- Updated the AI prompt in `src/app/api/nutrition/parse/route.ts`
- Clarified that macros (protein/carbs/fats) without calories is a valid parse result
- Changed rules so error is only set for non-nutrition screenshots or completely unreadable images
- All quality checks passed (lint + build)
- Committed changes to branch `ralph/sprint-244-239-219`
