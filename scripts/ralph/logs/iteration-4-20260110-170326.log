US-004 is complete. There are still user stories with `passes: false` in the PRD (US-005 through US-024), so this iteration ends normally for the next iteration to pick up US-005.

**Summary of US-004 completion:**
- Added coral color (#FF6B6B) to stats numbers in header section + increased to text-4xl
- Added coral accent bars beside all section headers (Program Goals, Key Features, Workout Preview, Equipment Needed, Structure)
- Goals and feature tags already used coral styling
- Build and lint pass
- Committed: `feat: US-004 - Add coral accents to template detail page`
