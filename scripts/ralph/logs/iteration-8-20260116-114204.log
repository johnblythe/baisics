There is still one story remaining: **US-009: Program Completion Notification** with `passes: false`. My iteration is complete - I've finished US-008 and another iteration will pick up US-009.

Let me summarize what was accomplished:

## US-008: Weekly Summary Notification - COMPLETE

**Implementation Summary:**
- Added user preference fields: `weeklySummaryEnabled` (default: true) and `weeklySummaryDay` (default: "monday")
- Created database migration for new fields
- Updated weekly summary service to filter by user preferences (enabled + matching day)
- Added weekly summary cron job to vercel.json (runs daily at 8am UTC)
- Created `/api/user/notifications` endpoint for GET/PATCH preference management
- Added notification settings UI to the `/settings` page with toggles and day selector
- Weekly summaries don't stack with daily reminders (8am vs 2pm UTC)
