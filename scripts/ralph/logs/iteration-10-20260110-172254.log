The WorkoutShareCard.tsx was committed. The PRD and progress files are modified but those are tracking files that get updated with each iteration.

Looking at the PRD, there are still stories with `passes: false` remaining (US-011 through US-024). The next iteration will pick up US-011 (Add share prompt after workout completion).

**Summary of US-010 completion:**

**Implemented:** Created `src/components/share/WorkoutShareCard.tsx` with:
- Card showing workout name, exercises completed count, duration (optional), streak count
- Branded coral gradient header with baisics logo
- Navy background with stats grid layout
- html2canvas integration for PNG image generation at 2x resolution
- Share options: Web Share API (with image file support on mobile), Twitter/X, Copy Link, Download PNG
- Responsive design following existing share card patterns

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Created `src/components/share/WorkoutShareCard.tsx`
