There are still stories with `passes: false`. US-005 is done but there are more stories (US-006 through US-014) remaining.

## Summary

**Completed: US-005 - Integrate new workout tracker components into workout page**

### What was implemented:
- Modified `src/app/workout/[id]/page.tsx` to use the 4 new workout tracker components
- Added imports for SetProgressGrid, BigSetInputCard, RestTimerControl, WorkoutProgressBar
- Added `selectedSetIndex` state for grid selection and `autoStartTimer` for rest timer preference
- Replaced the old SetInput-based UI with the new component layout:
  - SetProgressGrid showing 4-column set overview at top
  - WorkoutProgressBar showing exercise-level progress
  - BigSetInputCard for logging current/selected set (with coral gradient)
  - RestTimerControl at bottom with auto-start toggle
- Added `formatRestDuration()` helper to format seconds as "M:SS"
- Reset selectedSetIndex when navigating between exercises
- Shows a completion state when all sets are done
- Kept old SetInput component for backwards compatibility (not rendered)

### Quality checks:
- `npm run lint` passes (no errors for workout page)
- `npm run build` succeeds
