**US-002 Complete.** 

Summary of what was done:
- Updated `src/components/NutritionLogModal.tsx` lines 166-172
- Added a `hasMacros` check that uses `!= null` to detect if protein, carbs, or fats exist
- Error is now only shown if `data.error` is truthy AND no macros were extracted
- If macros exist but calories is null, processing continues normally (calories are auto-computed)
- Lint and build pass ✓
- Committed: `feat: [US-002] - Fix client error handling for partial nutrition data`

There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-003 through US-010), so another iteration will pick up the next story.
