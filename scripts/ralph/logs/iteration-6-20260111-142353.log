Now let me check if all stories are complete. Looking at the PRD:
- US-001 to US-006: `passes: true` ✓
- US-007: `passes: false` - Fix PhotoComparison Image error
- US-008: `passes: false` - Final verification

There are still stories with `passes: false`, so I'm done with this iteration. The next story to work on is US-007.

**Summary: US-006 Completed**

Implemented progress photos UX improvements for the check-in page:
- Added page-level drag-drop zone - users can now drag photos anywhere on the page
- Full-page drop overlay appears when dragging files over
- Progress Photos section auto-expands when photos are dropped
- Made the "Add Photos" section more prominent with coral gradient styling
- All quality checks pass (`npm run lint`, `npm run build`)
