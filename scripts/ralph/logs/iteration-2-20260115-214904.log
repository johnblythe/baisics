**Summary:**

Completed **US-002: Deep dive Duolingo retention mechanics**

Created `docs/research/236-competitor-duolingo.md` with:
- 7 core mechanics analyzed (streak system, hearts/lives, leagues, XP, notifications, celebrations, dark patterns)
- Psychological principles behind each mechanic with stats
- "What baisics could adapt" recommendations for each
- "What NOT to copy" section on dark patterns
- Prioritized summary table for implementation
- 14 sources cited

Key findings:
- Streak freeze INCREASES engagement (counterintuitive)
- Hearts/lives doesn't translate to fitness (skip it)
- Notifications are sophisticated but guilt marketing damages brand
- Must adapt daily streaks to allow rest days for fitness context
