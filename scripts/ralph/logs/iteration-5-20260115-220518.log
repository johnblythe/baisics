There are still 5 stories with `passes: false` (US-006 through US-010). I've completed US-005. Another iteration will pick up the next story (US-006).

**Summary of completed work:**

**US-005: Analyze Apple Fitness rings and awards** - COMPLETE

Created comprehensive research document at `docs/research/236-competitor-apple-fitness.md` covering:
- Three Activity Rings (Move/Exercise/Stand) with psychological analysis
- Award badges system (lifetime, limited-time, tiered)
- Social sharing and competition mechanics
- Monthly personalized challenges
- Celebration design and timing
- What NOT to copy (Apple-specific advantages, dark patterns to avoid)

Key insights for Baisics:
- "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" - three metrics beat dozens
- Lifetime milestones (100/365/500/1000 workouts) preserve progress without streak pressure
- Percentage-based scoring equalizes competition across fitness levels
- Rest days need to be celebrated, not penalized (users report "ring anxiety")
