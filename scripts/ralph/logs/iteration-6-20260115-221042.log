US-006 is complete. Let me check the remaining stories in the PRD:

- US-007: Create pattern library with tasteful vs kitsch ratings (passes: false)
- US-008: Design top 5 concepts with wireframes (passes: false)
- US-009: Create prioritized implementation roadmap (passes: false)
- US-010: Compile final research summary (passes: false)

There are still 4 stories with `passes: false`, so I should end my response normally for another iteration to pick up the next story.

**US-006 Complete!** 

Created `docs/research/236-journey-map.md` with:
- ASCII + Mermaid journey diagrams showing 9 key moments
- Dropout risk ratings (1-5) for each moment
- Intervention priority matrix (impact vs effort)
- Gap analysis identifying 4 critical missing features
- ASCII mockups for proposed interventions (First Workout Mode, Rest Day Screen, Missed Workout Recovery)

**Key findings:**
- **Critical gaps:** No rest day handling, silent failure on missed workouts, no Week 2 intervention, passive streak badge
- **Highest priority interventions:** Days 3-7 habit window, Week 2 dropout cliff, missed workout recovery, rest day framing
- **Existing strengths:** Good achievement infrastructure (share cards, badges) but underutilized

4 stories remaining (US-007 through US-010).
