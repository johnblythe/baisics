**US-007 Completed: Add transition error handling to ProgramBuilder**

Changes made:
- Added `toast` import from `sonner`
- Wrapped the `startTransition` server action call with try-catch
- On server action errors: shows both inline error state AND toast notification
- On network/unexpected errors: shows connection error toast with helpful message
- User now gets visual feedback (toast) instead of silent failure

Files changed: `src/app/program/create/components/ProgramBuilder.tsx`
