**Summary:** Completed US-004 - Deep dive Noom psychology-first approach

Created `docs/research/236-competitor-noom.md` with comprehensive analysis of:
- Color-coded food system and its cognitive load reduction
- Daily micro-lessons using CBT/DBT/ACT principles  
- Coach interactions (human + AI hybrid)
- Thought logging and reflection features
- Progress psychology with NoomCoin tokens
- Group support via Noom Circles
- Behavior chain analysis framework

Key insight: Noom's differentiator is teaching psychology *to* users rather than using it *on* them—creating meta-awareness that builds autonomy. The behavior chain framework (trigger → thought → action → consequence) translates directly to workout adherence. Also documented their $56M dark patterns settlement as a warning.
