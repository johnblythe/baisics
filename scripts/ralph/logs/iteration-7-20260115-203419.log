US-008 still has `passes: false`. Since I just completed US-007 (one story per iteration), my work is done. The next iteration will handle US-008.

**Summary:**
- ✅ Completed US-007: Option F: Social proof card
- Created `RestDayOptionF.tsx` with cyan/teal theme
- Shows "2,847 others are resting today" with avatar stack
- Includes "Top performers rest 2x per week" insight
- Updated page.tsx to render Option F
- Lint and build pass
- Committed: `feat: US-007 - Option F: Social proof card`
- Updated PRD (passes: true) and progress.txt
