I've completed **US-009: Create ExerciseCard component with emoji category icons**.

**Summary:**
- Created `src/components/exercise/ExerciseCard.tsx` with:
  - 56x56px category icon with emoji and label
  - Exercise name, sets, reps, rest display
  - 40x40px action buttons (Video, Swap, Expand)
  - Animated expandable section for notes/instructions
  - Support for both controlled and uncontrolled expand state

- Build and lint pass
- Committed: `feat: US-009 - Create ExerciseCard component with emoji category icons`
- PRD updated to mark US-009 as `passes: true`

There are still more stories with `passes: false` (US-010 through US-014).
