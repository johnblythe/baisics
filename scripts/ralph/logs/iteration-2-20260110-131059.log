**US-002 Completed**

I have successfully completed **US-002: Create BigSetInputCard component with coral gradient**.

**Summary:**
- Created `src/components/workout/BigSetInputCard.tsx` with all required features:
  - Coral gradient background (from-[#FF6B6B] to-[#EF5350])
  - Large set number display (text-3xl font-bold)
  - Target reps display on right side
  - Weight and Reps inputs with white/20 bg and text-xl font-bold
  - Full-width Complete Set button with white bg and coral text
  - Proper props interface for controlled inputs
- All quality checks passed (typecheck, lint, build)
- Committed with message: `feat: US-002 - Create BigSetInputCard component with coral gradient`
- Updated prd.json to mark US-002 as `passes: true`
- Appended progress to progress.txt

There are still stories with `passes: false` remaining (US-003 through US-014), so another iteration will pick up the next story.
