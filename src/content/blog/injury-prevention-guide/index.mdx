## Understanding Injury Prevention

### The Prehab Approach
Building on our [mobility guide](/blog/mobility-and-flexibility-guide):
1. Movement screening
2. Weakness identification
3. Targeted strengthening
4. [Recovery optimization](/blog/recovery-and-rest-guide)
5. Progressive loading

## Common Training Injuries

### Upper Body Issues
```
Shoulder Impingement:
- Poor scapular control
- Limited mobility
- Overuse patterns
- Technique errors

Elbow Tendinitis:
- Grip issues
- Volume spikes
- Recovery deficit
- Form breakdown
```

### Lower Body Concerns
```
Knee Pain:
- Tracking problems

- Hip weakness
- Ankle restrictions

Lower Back:
- Core instability
- Hip tightness
- Poor bracing
- Technical errors
```

## Movement Assessment

### Basic Screening
From our [program design guide](/blog/program-design-guide):
1. Overhead mobility
2. Hip hinge pattern
3. Single-leg stability
4. Core control
5. Movement symmetry

### Red Flags
1. Pain during movement
2. Significant asymmetry
3. Limited range
4. Poor control
5. Compensations

## Exercise-Specific Prehab

### Deadlift Preparation
Building on our [deadlift form guide](/blog/perfect-deadlift-form-guide):
```
Pre-lift routine:
1. Hip hinge practice
2. Core activation
3. Lat engagement
4. Glute activation
5. Movement pattern
```

### Squat Readiness
From our [squat form guide](/blog/squat-form-guide):
```
Pre-squat checklist:
1. Ankle mobility
2. Hip flexor length
3. Core bracing
4. Upper back prep
5. Pattern practice
```
