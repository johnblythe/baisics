_Learn why rest is crucial for gains and how to optimize your recovery days. Discover science-backed strategies to maximize your results while minimizing injury risk._

Many lifters focus intensely on their training sessions while overlooking one of the most crucial components of progress: recovery. In fact, it's during rest periods that your body actually builds strength and muscle.
