_Understanding exercise selection is crucial for training success, but you don't have to master it all yourself. Skip the complexity and [get a free program](/hi) with perfectly chosen exercises from baisics._

Proper exercise selection can make or break your training progress. While the principles we'll cover are important to understand, implementing them perfectly requires deep knowledge of biomechanics, individual limitations, and proper progression.

> **Skip the Guesswork**  
> While this guide explains exercise selection in detail, you can get a perfectly optimized exercise program in seconds. [Try baisics' free program builder](/hi) and let AI handle the complex decisions while you focus on training.

## Movement Pattern Foundations

### Primary Patterns
```
Essential Movements:
- Squat (vertical knee/hip)
- Hinge (horizontal hip)
- Push (vertical/horizontal)
- Pull (vertical/horizontal)
- Carry (locomotion/stability)
```

### Pattern Considerations
1. Joint health
2. Mobility requirements
3. Technical demands
4. Loading potential
5. Risk/reward ratio
