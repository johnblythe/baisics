## The Science Behind Foam Rolling

### Physiological Effects
Building on our [recovery guide](/blog/recovery-and-rest-guide):
1. Increased blood flow
2. Fascial release
3. Neural relaxation
4. Tissue hydration
5. Pain reduction

### Research-Backed Benefits
```
Benefit                 Improvement
ROM Increase           10-15%
DOMS Reduction         20-40%
Performance            5-10%
Recovery Speed         15-25%
Pain Reduction         30-50%
```

## Essential Foam Rolling Techniques

### Basic Principles
1. Roll slowly (1 inch per second)
2. Target specific areas
3. Breathe consistently
4. Maintain core tension
5. Control pressure

### Common Mistakes
1. Rolling too fast
2. Excessive pressure
3. Poor positioning
4. Wrong timing
5. Improper technique

## Complete Muscle-by-Muscle Guide
