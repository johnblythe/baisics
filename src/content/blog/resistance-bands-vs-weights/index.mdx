Free Weight   | 100% of 1RM
```

### Strength Gains
```
12-Week Study Results:
Bands: 15-20% strength increase
Weights: 20-25% strength increase
Combined: 25-30% strength increase
```

## Optimal Uses for Each

### Resistance Bands Best For
1. Beginners
2. Rehabilitation
3. Travel workouts
4. Space constraints
5. Budget concerns

### Free Weights Best For
1. Maximum strength
2. Power development
3. Sport specific
4. Precise loading
5. Competition goals
