_Learn how to perform the squat with perfect form. From setup to execution, discover the essential cues and fixes for one of the most important compound exercises._

The squat, along with the [deadlift](/blog/perfect-deadlift-form-guide), is a fundamental movement pattern that's crucial for building overall strength and muscle. As one of the most effective [compound exercises](/blog/compound-vs-isolation-exercises), mastering proper squat form is essential for maximizing benefits while minimizing injury risk.

## The Importance of Proper Squat Form

Proper squat form:
- Maximizes muscle activation
- Reduces injury risk
- Improves functional strength
- Enhances athletic performance
- Builds lower body power

## Perfect Squat Setup: Step-by-Step

### 1. Bar Position
- Upper back placement
- Tight shoulder retraction
- Bar path alignment
- Hand grip width

### 2. Stance Setup
- Hip-width stance
- Foot angle (15-30°)
- Weight distribution
- Center of gravity

### 3. Bracing
- 360° core tension
- Proper breathing
- Upper back tightness
- Maintaining position

## The Perfect Squat Movement Pattern

### Phase 1: The Setup
1. Approach the bar
2. Set upper back position
3. Create full-body tension
4. Take walking steps
5. Set stance width

### Phase 2: The Descent
1. Break at hips and knees
2. Control the eccentric
3. Maintain back angle
4. Track knees over toes
5. Reach proper depth

### Phase 3: The Drive
1. Drive through full foot
2. Maintain back angle
3. Keep chest up
4. Push knees out
5. Stand to lockout

## Common Squat Mistakes and Fixes

Similar to [breaking through plateaus](/blog/breaking-through-strength-plateaus#3-address-weak-points), identifying and fixing form issues is crucial:

### 1. Knee Cave (Valgus)
**Problem:**
- Knees collapse inward
- Reduced power output
- Increased joint stress

**Solution:**
- Strengthen glutes
- Cue "spread the floor"
- Address mobility issues
- Use proper stance width

### 2. Butt Wink
**Problem:**
- Pelvis tucks under
- Lower back rounds
- Compromised position

**Solution:**
- Work on mobility
- Adjust depth temporarily
- Strengthen core
- Check stance width

### 3. Forward Lean
**Problem:**
- Excessive torso bend
- Bar path issues
- Back strain risk

**Solution:**
- Core bracing work
- Upper back strength
- Ankle mobility
- Proper breathing

## Mobility Requirements for Squatting

### Essential Mobility Areas
1. Ankles
2. Hips
3. Thoracic spine
4. Shoulders
5. Knees

### Mobility Drills
- Ankle rocks
- Hip flexor stretches
- Thoracic extensions
- Shoulder dislocates
- Movement prep routine

## Progressive Loading Strategies

Just like with [progressive overload](/blog/ultimate-guide-progressive-overload), proper progression is key:

### Beginner (0-6 months)
```
Week 1-2: Master bodyweight form
Week 3-4: Add light weight
Week 5-6: Begin working sets
```

### Intermediate (6-18 months)
```
Focus on technique
Add volume gradually
Implement variations
```

### Advanced (18+ months)
```
Specialized programming
Varied rep ranges
Competition preparation
```

## Squat Variations and When to Use Them

### 1. High-Bar Back Squat
- Traditional form
- Quad emphasis
- Athletic performance

### 2. Low-Bar Back Squat
- Powerlifting style
- More hip drive
- Heavier weights possible

### 3. Front Squat
- Upper back emphasis
- More upright torso
- Core stability focus

## Safety Considerations

### Pre-squat Checklist
- Equipment check
- Proper warm-up
- Mental preparation
- Space clearance
- Spotter availability

### When to Stop a Set
- Form breakdown
- Technical failure
- Excessive fatigue
- Pain or discomfort

## Recovery and Programming

### Optimal Frequency
- Beginners: 2-3x/week
- Intermediate: 2x/week
- Advanced: Based on volume/intensity

### Recovery Protocols
