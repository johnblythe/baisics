        The post-workout "anabolic window" has been a hot topic in fitness for years. But what does the 
        science actually say about protein timing? Let's separate fact from fiction.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        For decades, gym-goers have rushed to consume protein immediately after workouts, believing they 
        would miss out on gains if they didn't hit the mythical "anabolic window." Recent research has 
        shed new light on this practice, revealing some surprising findings about protein timing and 
        muscle growth.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">What Is the Anabolic Window?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Traditionally, the anabolic window was thought to be a 30-45 minute period after exercise where 
          the body is especially primed for nutrient absorption and muscle growth.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          The concept of a narrow anabolic window has been largely debunked by modern research. While 
          protein timing isn't irrelevant, it's far less important than:
        </p>
        <BlogList items={[
          "Meeting daily protein requirements",
          "Maintaining consistent training",
          "Getting adequate calories",
          "Quality sleep and recovery",
          "Overall dietary adherence"
        ]} />

        <p className="mt-4 mb-4">
          For most people, focusing on these fundamentals will yield better results than stressing about 
          precise protein timing. The "window of opportunity" for protein consumption is much wider than 
          previously thought, giving you more flexibility in your nutrition planning.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Remember: Consistency in your overall approach matters more than perfection in timing. Focus on 
          the basics first, and only worry about precise timing if you've already optimized everything else.
