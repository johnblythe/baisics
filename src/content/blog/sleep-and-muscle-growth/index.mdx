## The Science of Sleep and Muscle Growth

### Key Sleep Functions
Building on our [recovery guide](/blog/recovery-and-rest-guide):
1. Muscle protein synthesis
2. Growth hormone release
3. Cortisol regulation
4. Tissue repair
5. Neural recovery

### Critical Sleep Cycles
```
Stage         Duration    Primary Benefits
Light         30-45 min   Neural rest
Deep          60-90 min   Physical recovery
REM           90-120 min  Mental recovery
Full Cycle    90-110 min  Complete restoration
```

## How Poor Sleep Impacts Gains

### Hormonal Effects
```
Hormone          Impact of Sleep Loss
Growth Hormone   ↓ 40-60%
Testosterone     ↓ 10-15%
IGF-1           ↓ 20-30%
Cortisol        ↑ 15-20%
```

### Performance Metrics
```
Metric              24h No Sleep  
Strength            ↓ 11%
Power Output        ↓ 17%
Reaction Time       ↓ 13%
Training Volume     ↓ 20%
Recovery Rate       ↓ 30%
```

## Optimal Sleep Requirements

### By Training Level
```
Category        Hours Needed
Recreational    7-8 hours
Intermediate    8-9 hours
Advanced        9-10 hours
Elite           10+ hours
```

### Quality Indicators
1. Sleep latency (time to fall asleep)
2. Sleep continuity
3. Deep sleep percentage
4. REM sleep cycles
5. Morning recovery feeling

## Sleep Optimization Strategies

### Environment Setup
Building on our [home gym guide](/blog/small-space-home-gym-guide):
1. Temperature control (65-68°F)
2. Complete darkness
3. White noise options
4. Quality mattress
5. Proper pillows

### Evening Routine
1. Consistent schedule
2. Blue light reduction
3. Relaxation practices
4. Nutrition timing
5. Activity wind-down

## Nutrition and Sleep

### Pre-Sleep Nutrition
```
Nutrient         Timing          Amount
Protein          1-2 hrs before  20-40g
Carbs            2-3 hrs before  Low-moderate
Magnesium        1 hr before     200-400mg
Casein           Before bed      20-40g
```

### Foods to Avoid
