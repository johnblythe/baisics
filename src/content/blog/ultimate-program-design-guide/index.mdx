_Understanding program design principles is valuable, but you don't have to do it yourself. Skip the complexity and [get a free personalized program](/hi) instantly with baisics._

Creating an effective training program is both an art and a science. While the principles we'll cover are universal, implementing them perfectly requires careful consideration of your goals, recovery capacity, and lifestyle constraints.

> **Skip the Complexity**  
> While this guide explains program design in detail, you can get a perfectly optimized training program in seconds. [Try baisics' free program builder](/hi) and let AI handle the science while you focus on training.

## Program Design Fundamentals

### Key Principles
```
Foundation Elements:
- Progressive overload
- Recovery management
- Volume optimization
- Exercise selection
- Training frequency
```

### Individual Considerations
1. Training experience
2. Recovery capacity
3. Schedule constraints
4. Equipment access
5. Injury history

> **Let AI Handle Your Programming**  
> Instead of juggling all these variables yourself, [let baisics analyze your needs](/hi) and create a perfectly balanced program instantly.

## Training Split Selection

### Common Splits
1. Full Body
   - 3-4x per week
   - Even distribution
   - Higher frequency
   - [Recovery focused](/blog/recovery-and-rest-guide)

2. Upper/Lower
   - 4-6x per week
   - Balanced approach
   - Moderate frequency
   - Good recovery

3. Push/Pull/Legs
   - 3-6x per week
   - Movement based
   - Flexible frequency
   - Popular choice
