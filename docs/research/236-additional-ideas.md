## Open Questions

1. **Social vs Solo** - How much social do we want? Accountability pods are powerful but complex
2. **Badge inflation** - How many badges before they feel meaningless?
3. **Notification strategy** - Which achievements warrant push notifications?
4. **Coach tier overlap** - Which features are free vs coach-only?
5. **Learning center vs blog** - Same content, different format? Or distinct?
