  "name": "Upper Body Hypertrophy Breakthrough",
  "description": "An 8-week progressive overload program designed to break through your bench press plateau and build significant upper body muscle mass. Combines strength protocols with hypertrophy techniques using strategic supersets for time efficiency while respecting your shoulder limitation.",

      "name": "Foundation & Volume Accumulation",
      "durationWeeks": 4,
      "focus": "Building work capacity and addressing weak points through strategic volume",
      "explanation": "This phase establishes a solid foundation by increasing training volume progressively while identifying and strengthening weak links in your pressing chain. We'll use moderate weights with higher rep ranges to build muscle tissue and improve work capacity, setting the stage for heavier lifting in phase 2.",
      "expectations": "Expect muscle soreness in weeks 1-2 as your body adapts to increased volume. Your bench press may not increase immediately, but you'll notice improved muscle fullness and endurance. Energy levels should stabilize by week 3.",
