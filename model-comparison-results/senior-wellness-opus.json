  "description": "A safe, progressive strength training program designed for maintaining bone density, improving balance, and supporting independence. This program uses machine-based and supported exercises appropriate for someone with knee arthritis and a hip replacement history, while building functional strength for daily activities with grandchildren.",

      "name": "Foundation & Functional Strength",
      "durationWeeks": 4,
      "focus": "Building baseline strength, improving balance confidence, and establishing safe movement patterns",
      "explanation": "This foundational phase focuses on machine-based exercises that provide stability and support while building strength in key areas for bone health and daily function. All exercises are performed standing or seated on equipment - no floor work required. The emphasis is on controlled movements, proper breathing, and gradual progression to build confidence and physical capacity safely.",
      "expectations": "Expect mild muscle soreness in the first 1-2 weeks as your body adapts. You should feel more stable and confident in your movements by week 2. Energy levels may improve, and you'll likely notice everyday tasks becoming easier. The weight-bearing exercises will help stimulate bone density maintenance. Listen to your body - some joint stiffness is normal, but sharp pain is not.",

Aim for 25-30g protein at each meal from sources like eggs, fish, chicken, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, and legumes. Calcium and Vitamin D are essential - consider fortified foods or supplements if not getting enough from diet. Stay well hydrated - aim for 6-8 glasses of water daily, more on workout days. Collagen supplements may support joint health but discuss with your doctor. Limit processed foods and added sugars which can increase inflammation and worsen arthritis symptoms."
