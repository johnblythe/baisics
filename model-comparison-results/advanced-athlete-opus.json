  "name": "83kg Powerlifting Meet Prep - 12 Week Peak",
  "description": "A periodized 12-week powerlifting meet preparation program designed to peak your squat, bench press, and deadlift for competition. This program progresses from an accumulation phase building work capacity, through an intensification phase increasing intensity, culminating in a peaking and taper phase to express maximal strength on meet day.",

  "phases": [
    {
      "phaseNumber": 1,
      "name": "Accumulation Phase",
      "durationWeeks": 4,
      "focus": "Building work capacity, refining technique, and establishing baseline strength through moderate intensity volume work",
      "explanation": "This phase builds the foundation for your peak by accumulating quality training volume at submaximal intensities. The higher rep ranges and moderate loads will reinforce proper motor patterns, address weak points through targeted accessory work, and build the work capacity needed to handle the heavier intensities coming in later phases. RPE stays controlled at 7-8 to ensure quality reps and avoid early fatigue accumulation.",
      "expectations": "Expect moderate fatigue accumulation throughout this phase. You should feel challenged but recovered enough to hit all prescribed work. Focus on bar speed and technical precision rather than grinding reps. Weight on the bar will feel manageable - this is intentional. Trust the process as we build toward heavier work.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Focus on technical proficiency and bar speed at submaximal weights",
        "Build work capacity through higher volume sets",
        "Address weak points: lockout work for bench/deadlift, off-the-floor strength for deadlift",
