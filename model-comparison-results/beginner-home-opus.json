      "name": "Foundation Building",
      "durationWeeks": 4,
      "focus": "Establishing movement patterns, building muscular endurance, and creating sustainable exercise habits",
      "explanation": "This phase introduces you to fundamental strength training movements using bodyweight and light resistance. The focus is on learning proper form, building work capacity, and creating a consistent routine you can maintain. By starting with manageable intensity, you'll reduce injury risk while building the foundation for future progress.",
      "expectations": "Expect mild muscle soreness in the first 1-2 weeks as your body adapts. You should feel more energized and confident in your movements by week 2. Energy levels may fluctuate initially but will stabilize as your body adjusts to morning training. Focus on quality over quantity - it's okay if exercises feel challenging.",

        "Master proper form before adding resistance",
        "Build the habit of consistent 3x/week training",
        "Listen to your body and respect your lower back",
