              "focus": "Building work capacity, refining technique, and establishing baseline strength through moderate intensity volume work",
              "explanation": "This phase builds the foundation for your peak by accumulating quality training volume at submaximal intensities. The higher rep ranges and moderate loads will reinforce proper motor patterns, address weak points through targeted accessory work, and build the work capacity needed to handle the heavier intensities coming in later phases. RPE stays controlled at 7-8 to ensure quality reps and avoid early fatigue accumulation.",
              "expectations": "Expect moderate fatigue accumulation throughout this phase. You should feel challenged but recovered enough to hit all prescribed work. Focus on bar speed and technical precision rather than grinding reps. Weight on the bar will feel manageable - this is intentional. Trust the process as we build toward heavier work.",

All exercises are performed standing or seated on equipment - no floor work required. The emphasis is on controlled movements, proper breathing, and gradual progression to build confidence and physical capacity safely.",

Energy levels may improve, and you'll likely notice everyday tasks becoming easier. The weight-bearing exercises will help stimulate bone density maintenance.
