  "description": "An 8-week progressive strength program designed specifically for postpartum recovery with diastasis recti considerations. This program rebuilds core stability from the inside out while safely restoring full-body strength using home equipment with quiet, baby-nap-friendly exercises.",

      "name": "Foundation & Core Reconnection",
      "durationWeeks": 4,
      "focus": "Rebuild deep core stability, restore mind-muscle connection, and establish safe movement patterns",
      "explanation": "This phase prioritizes healing your diastasis recti while rebuilding foundational strength. We focus on deep core activation (transverse abdominis), diaphragmatic breathing patterns, and controlled movements that create intra-abdominal pressure safely. All exercises are selected to avoid excessive forward abdominal pressure that could worsen separation.",
      "expectations": "You may feel like the exercises are 'too easy' at first - this is intentional. Expect to feel deep core muscles activating that you may have lost connection with. Some muscle soreness is normal, but stop if you notice coning/doming of your abdomen during any exercise. Energy levels may fluctuate with postpartum demands.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Focus on exhaling during exertion to engage deep core",
        "Stop any exercise if you see abdominal coning or doming",
